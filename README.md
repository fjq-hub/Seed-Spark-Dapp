Seedspark is a next-generation solution built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to revolutionize how project creators and contributors engage in fundraising activities. It will incorporate smart contract functionality to automate the donation process and issuance of utility tokens as rewards for contributors.

The primary purpose of Seedspark is to democratize access to funding, catering to a wide range of project creators, including start-ups, individuals, and non-profit organizations across various industries, providing them with an accessible and equitable means to raise funds. It aims to achieve some key objectives that address the limitations faced by traditional crowdfunding models such as security, autonomy and accessibility.

The contracts allow initiators to start projects, set primary funding goals and ending dates. It also add flexibilities to the control of the projects. Initiators are able to alter their projects in the middle of fund raising, either to cancel it or extend the fund raising period. 

The contracts also made it possible for contributors to donate as well as retriving their donation, depending on their personal preference.

We have designed a utility token for rewarding and incentive purposes, which will bring potential revenue to the platform itself.
